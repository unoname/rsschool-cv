### About Me

I am a lawyer by training. I have experience in this field. I also worked as a household appliance repairman. In 2020, I took web development courses from the employment center. Since the course program was weak, I left programming for about a year. In 2021, I completed programming courses at Innopolis University. There I learned about RSShool. I really like programming and I think that RSSchool can help me master this profession. That's why I'm here (RSShool).
